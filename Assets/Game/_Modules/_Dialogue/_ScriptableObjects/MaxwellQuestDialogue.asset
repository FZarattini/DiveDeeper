  - Hey man. Sorry, The stock is gone again..
  - The deliveries should be here now though, it is really not common for them to
    delay like this.
  - Say what. Could you go to the harbor and see if the goods are there yet? I will
    give you something as payment for it, of course.
  - Here, take this for protection. It's just a farming tool, but it hurts just as
    much as an axe if you hit something in the head with it!
  - Remember, you just need to click with your mouse to hit in front of you.
  - To reach the harbor, just go through the village exit in the south!
