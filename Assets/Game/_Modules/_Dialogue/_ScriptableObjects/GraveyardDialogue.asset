  - As that dream ended, I realized all the happy moments we got through together.
  - It wasn't long, but I was truly happy.
  - I used to be lonely, always cooped up in my house by myself. But meeting you
    made me see how important it is to go out and talk to people.
  - You will be missed..Thank you
