  - 05/30 - I still can't believe it happened.
  - Father Travis said Gizmo was probably attacked by the monsters in the Cave.
  - The other rats must have tried to save him and failed.
  - 07/12 - People in the village come visit me sometimes. They keep trying to convince
    me Tony is very ashamed of what he's done..
  - He is just a kid, I don't really blame him..
  - 08/25 - I keep having these dreams of all the moments we've had together. Of
    what happened..
  - It is hard, but it also makes it easier..
  - The more I dive into my own memories, I realize how it was a blessing having
    met you..
