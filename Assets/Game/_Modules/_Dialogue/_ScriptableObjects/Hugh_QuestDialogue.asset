  - Good mornin... Oh, the old missus told I needed help?
  - That old coot, she didn't have to do that..
  - Well, I didn't wanna bother you. But since you are here..
  - Would you mind helping me sorting out the boxes in my basement?
  - It's been a mess down there for ages now.
  - 'But my back don''t let me get down the stairs anymore. If you go down there,
    just push the small boxes to the free spaces. '
  - If you somehow get stuck, just step back a little and they'll come back to their
    original positions.
  - Don't ask me how it works.
  - Here, let me open it for you!
