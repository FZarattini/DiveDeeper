  - 05/20 - It's been almost a month since I met Gizmo.
  - We do everything together!
  - I even made him a little hat! He looks very cute now!
  - Yesterday we went swimming into the lake and it was tons of fun!
  - I think today we will go to the village store and see if there's anything cool
    to buy for Gizmo.
