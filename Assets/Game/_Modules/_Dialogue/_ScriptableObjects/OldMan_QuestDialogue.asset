  - Good mornin... Oh, the old missus told I needed help?
  - That old coot, she didn't have to do that..
  - Well, I didn't wanna bother you. But since you are here..
  - Would you mind helping me sorting out the boxes in my basement? It's been a mess
    down there for ages now.
  - But my back don't let me get down the stairs anymore. If you go down there, just
    push the small boxes to the free spaces. If you somehow get stuck, just get on
    the blue spot on the ground and press 'E' to reset the boxes.
