  - Good Morning. I've come to pray to the sacred altar for the village's blessing!
  - Our village was built around it and legend says it is bottomless!
  - There's a legend that says if someone dives in it they would reach enlightenment!
  - Of course no one has ever done it before. We believe it is sacred and only drink
    from it.
  - It would be heresy to sully these waters with our bodies..
